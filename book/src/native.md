# Native Plugins

Currently, you can develop two types of native plugins for EasyML:


## 1. **Provider Plugins**
Provider plugins are designed to **return data within a specific period of time**.

Use this type of plugin when you need to fetch or manage data that EasyML processes.


## 2. **Hook Plugins**
Hook plugins are used to **send details of detected anomalies to an external system**.
